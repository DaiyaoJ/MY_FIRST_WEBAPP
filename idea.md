                                                        My Project Idea
                                                        
Objective: To build a simple hangman game application
The programming language I believe to used in this project are:
            HTML
            Javscript
            CSS
HTML is used to define the structure of a web page which can contain the image of the 'hangman'
Javascript is used to build the functions inside game or web applications
CSS is used to style the HTML document so may be give the web page some colors

Basic ideas of the hangman game:
    --> A word is randomly chosen for player to guess
    --> Player can see how many letters made up of this word at the beginning
    --> Each correct guess reveals every location where the letter exists in the word. Each incorrect guess results in piece of the man added to the gallows
    --> Once the player knows the word, he allows to guess the entire word
    --> Player wins if he successfully guesses the word. Otherwise, he loses and restarts the game
